# filenfo

## project
this is an effort to catalog all thps releases at a file level with a priorty on beta/prototypes. the data will aid in analysis of the relationships and timelines for releases. the same method may be used to feed svgt @ timeline.mameau.com for other titles in the future

this repo is the main info dump with the intent for this data to collated into a usable form e.g. sql with web frontend or similar.

still need to identify tools for more systems so we can process the dumps
